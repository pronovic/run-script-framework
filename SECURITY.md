# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This is a build utility, not a software library, and I make no specific claims about compatibility from commit to commit.  The repository is not formally versioned or tagged.  In practice, I rarely remove features, and I strive to maintain backwards compatibility.  However, I will provide security support only for features currently available in the default branch.  I reserve the right to remove a feature, or adjust that feature's interface in a breaking manner, to mitigate a reported security problem.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a security issue, please use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/pronovic/run-script-framework/security/advisories/new) tab.
